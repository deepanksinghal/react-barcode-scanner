Scan 1D Barcodes from browser's webcam.

This project uses nu-book/zxing-cpp wasm wrapper for increased performance. 

Instead of Full Screen scan, it uses a smaller canvas box for increased performance.

A time-interval in milliseconds can also be configured to ignore duplicate barcode scanning within that interval.

Work In Progress! PRs are welcome.
